A console-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that answers questions based on the content of PDF files.
It uses LangChain, ChromaDB, and Groq-hosted LLMs to perform semantic search and generate accurate, context-aware answers.


✨ Features:\
Upload and process PDF files\
Semantic search using vector embeddings\
Answers grounded strictly in PDF content\
Handles large PDFs efficiently with chunking\
Clean console-based interaction\
Prevents hallucinated answers\
Secure API key handling via environment variables

 
🛠️ Tech Stack: \
Python\
LangChain\
ChromaDB\
Groq (LLM inference)\
HuggingFace Sentence Transformers\
PyPDF2

🚀 Setup & Installation
1. Clone the repository: 

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/rag-project.git
cd rag-project

2. Create and activate virtual environment

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set up environment variables: Create a .env file:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here


▶️ Running the Application:

TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false venv/bin/python RAG_APPLICATION.py

How it works:
1. Select a PDF file when prompted
2. The PDF is indexed using vector embeddings
3. Ask questions in the terminal
4. The system retrieves relevant content and generates answers
5. Type exit to quit

🧪 Example Queries:\
--> Summarize the PDF\
--> What are the key points of the document?
>>If an answer is not found in the PDF, the system responds:
Not found in the PDF.

🔒 Notes
-API keys are never committed to GitHub \
-The application only answers based on document content\
-Designed to handle large PDFs without exceeding token limits
